Description: # Sua_lib - Simple Exploratory data analysis and linear regression for predict store openings based in geodataframes
        
        ## What is it / what does it do?
        
        This is a python package that processes dataframes obtaining a geodataframe based on POINT geometries to predict store openings from a retailer.
        
        Using different functions we could create datasets, cleaning data, exploring it and create a simple linear regression model to predict store openings. 
        
        Each part of functions was divided in different modules, in case user prefers to use it spliting it in different use cases.
        
        ## How do I install it?
        Just use 'pip install sua_lib' if you have pip installed (as most systems do). Or download the zip distribution from this site, unzip it and then:
        
        * Mac: `cd` into it, and enter `sudo python setup.py install` along with your system password.
        * Windows: Same thing but without `sudo`.
        
        ## How does it work?
        Let's look at some sample code. To get point geometry column based on latitude and longitude:
        
            >>> from sua_lib.working_geo import create_geometry_column
            >>> df = df_unified
            >>> lat_col = df_unified['latitude']
            >>> lon_col = df_unified['longitude']
            >>> gdf = create_geometry_column(df,lat_col,lon_col)
